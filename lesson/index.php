						echo "<p align=justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biological Science is the study of living things. Who were some of the major names in early Biological Science? One of the people involved in early Biological Science was a man named Robert Hooke. What exactly did Robert Hooke Do? He was an English scientist alive in the 1660s. He studied the oak under a microscope at his time. During the 1660s the ability to magnify objects was 30xs the strength, as oposed to today where we can magnify objects on a much smaller level and get more detail. As Robert Hooke looked through the microscope, he discovered what are known cells.</p>";
						echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Another of the people associated with early biology is a man named Anton van Leeuwenhoek. After reading about Robert Hooke's results with the 30x power microscope, Van Leeuwenhoek Decided to get in on the action as well. Anton van Leeuwenhoek developed a higher microscope that could study things at 300x power. The higher power microscope enabled van Leeunwenhoek to study pond water. Van Leeuweenhoek was one of the pioneers to study single celled organisms.</p>";
						echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Who were the others who were associated with early biology? The other two men was Marcello Malphigi and Lorenzo Oken were also associated with biology in the early days. Marcello Malphigi studied biology in the 1670s. Malhpigi's theory said that the plant structures like leaves are composed of cells as well.</p>";
						echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-A forth man who is instrumental in the study of early biology was Lorenzo Oken. Lorenzo Oken studied biology in the early 1800s around 1805. Then in the late 1830s two other early biologists backed up Oken's findings. Oken stated that any living oraganism is made up of cells. More early biologists in the 1800s were Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. Both Schlieden and Schwann agreed with Oken's Findings. Schlieden and Schwann observed differentplants to come up with this conclusion. Other scientists living at this time came to the same conclusion after numerous observations were made.</p>";
						echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to the next question: How many organisms are made of cells?<br/>-Both small and large organisms are composed of cells. This size of cells ranges from a tiny bacteria to a whale in the ocean. The bacteria are tin y and composed of cells. According to the early scientists Oken, Schleiden, and Schwann, that is what organisms are made of. As of today this theory holds true.</p>";

					elseif(isset($_GET['history'])){
						echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of biology traces the study of the living world from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of biology as a single coherent field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from traditions of medicine and natural history reaching back to ayurveda, ancient Egyptian medicine and the works of Aristotle and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman world. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by Muslim physicians and scholars such as Avicenna. During the European Renaissance and early modern period, biological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were Vesalius and Harvey, who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as Linnaeus and Buffon who began to classify the diversity of life and the fossil record, as well as the development and behavior of organisms. Microscopy revealed the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for cell theory. The growing importance of natural theology, partly a response to the rise of mechanical philosophy, encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the argument from design).</p>";
						echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the 18th and 19th centuries, biological sciences such as botany and zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Lavoisier and other physical scientists began to connect the animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography‚Äîlaying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation and the rise of the germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery.</p>";
						echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of Mendel's work led to the rapid development of genetics by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of population genetics and natural selection in the "."neo-Darwinian synthesis".". New disciplines developed rapidly, especially after Watson and Crick proposed the structure of DNA. Following the establishment of the Central Dogma and the cracking of the genetic code, biology was largely split between organismal biology‚Äîthe fields that deal with whole organisms and groups of organisms‚Äîand the fields related to cellular and molecular biology. By the late 20th century, new fields like genomics and proteomics were reversing this trend, with organismal biologists using molecular techniques, and molecular and cell biologists investigating the interplay between genes and the environment, as well as the genetics of natural populations of organisms.</p>";

						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word biology is formed by combining the Greek Œ≤ŒØŒøœÇ (bios), meaning "life", and the suffix "-logy", meaning "science of", "knowledge of", "study of", based on the Greek verb ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒµŒπŒΩ, "legein" "to select", "to gather" (cf. the noun ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ, "logos""word"). The term biology in its modern sense appears to have been introduced independently by Karl Friedrich Burdach (in 1800), Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (Biologie odder Philosophies deer livened Nature, 1802) and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (Hydrog√©ologie, 1802). The word itself appears in the title of Volume 3 of Michael Christoph Hanov'."s".' Philosophiae naturalis sive physical dogmatic: Geologic, biologia, phytologia generalis et dendrologia, published in 1766.</p>';
						
						echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before biology, there were several terms used for the study of animals and plants. Natural history referred to the descriptive aspects of biology, though it also included mineralogy and other non-biological fields; from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance, the unifying framework of natural history was the scale nature or Being. Natural and natural theology encompassed the conceptual and metaphysical basis of plant and animal life, dealing with problems of why organisms exist and behave the way they do, though these subjects also included what is now geology, physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Physiology and (botanical) pharmacology were the province of medicine. Botany, zoology, and (in the case of fossils) geology replaced natural history and natural philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries </p>";

This requirement for direct contact allows for very precise control of cell differentiation during embryonic development. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, two cells of the developing gonad each have an equal chance of terminally differentiating or becoming a uterine precursor cell that continues to divide. The choice of which cell continues to divide is controlled by competition of cell surface signals. One cell will happen to produce more of a cell surface protein that activates the Notch receptor on the adjacent cell. This activates a feedback loop or system that reduces Notch expression in the cell that will differentiate and that increases Notch on the surface of the cell that continues as a stem cell.</p>";
					echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many cell signals are carried by molecules that are released by one cell and move to make contact with another cell. Endocrine signals are called hormones. Hormones are produced by endocrine cells and they travel through the blood to reach all parts of the body. Specificity of signaling can be controlled if only some cells can respond to a particular hormone. Paracrine signals such as retinoic acid target only cells in the vicinity of the emitting cell. Neurotransmitters represent another example of a paracrine signal. Some signaling molecules can function as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter. For example, epinephrine and norepinephrine can function as hormones when released from the adrenal gland and are transported to the heart by way of the blood stream. Norepinephrine can also be produced by neurons to function as a neurotransmitter within the brain. Estrogen can be released by the ovary and function as a hormone or act locally via paracrine or autocrine signaling.[8] Active species of oxygen and nitric oxide can also act as cellular messengers. This process is dubbed redox signaling.&nbsp;</p>";
					echo "<p align='justify'><b>Receptors for cell moves</b></p>";
					echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cells receive information from their environment through a class of proteins known as receptors. Notch is a cell surface protein that functions as a receptor. Animals have a small set of genes that code for signaling proteins that interact specifically with Notch receptors and stimulate a response in cells that express Notch on their surface. Molecules that activate (or, in some cases, inhibit) receptors can be classified as hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and growth factors, but all of these are called receptor ligands. The details of ligand-receptor interactions are fundamental to cell signaling.</p>";
					echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in Notch acts as a receptor for ligands that are expressed on adjacent cells. While many receptors are cell surface proteins, some are found inside cells. For example, estrogen is a hydrophobic molecule that can pass through the lipid bilayer of cell surface membranes. Estrogen receptors inside cells of the uterus can be activated by estrogen that comes from the ovaries, enters the target cells, and binds to estrogen receptors.</p>";
					echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of transmembrane receptors for molecules that include peptide hormones and of intracellular receptors for steroid hormones exist, giving to a cell the ability to respond to a great number of hormonal and pharmacological stimuli. In diseases, often, proteins that interact with receptors are aberrantly activated, resulting in constitutively activated downstream signals.</p>";
					echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several types of intercellular signaling molecules that are unable to permeate the hydrophobic cell membrane due to their hydrophilic nature, the target receptor is expressed on the membrane. When such signaling molecule activates its receptor, the signal is carried into the cell usually by means of a second messenger such as cAMP.</p>";

These cells star throughout the video. The smaller cells are cultured mouse epithelial cells. The very large pulsing cell, speeded up by time-lapse, is the slime mould Physarum. A little later is an antheridium and spiral oogonium of the alga Chara (note the streaming); then a Tradescantia stamen hair and a diatom (alga).</br>
<b>CYTOPLASM </b> -cultured newt cells. The motion of the cell margin, called "ruffling", is an actin-based movement common in many animal cells.</br>
<b>MITOCHONDRIA </b> -cultured newt cells and PtK (mammalian) cells.</br> 
</b>CHLOROPLASTS </b> -To see chloroplasts in living cells: place a small, pale green leaf of Impatiens (the common garden flower) in water and then aspirate under a vacuum; over about 30 mins. bubbles will appear as air expands through the stomata. Then remove the vacuum slowly. Water will then fill the air spaces in the mesophyll. Now mount the leaf under water: the tissue should be transparent while cells and cellular activity should be clear. The red alga releasing spores (carpospores) in Spyridia; the next (red filaments) is Erythrocladia and the bluish-green one is Chroodactylon.</br>
<b>ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM </b> -cells of epidermal peel from an onion prepared as above. </br>
<b>GOLGI BODIES</b> -the first transmission electron micrograph is from frozen mouse epididymal cells; next is by a transmission electron micrograph of a golgi body in the green alga Oedogonium. The live green algal cell is Micrasterias followed by the diatom Surirella. During pinocytosis, in mouse macrophages and newt cells, watch carefully to see the vesicles forming at the cell margin. The feeding protozoan is probably Actinophrys. The alga secreting tine plates, called scales, is Pleurochrysis, and the scanning micrographs are of scales from the closely related Coccolithus. </br>
<b>VACUOLES</b> -Celery stems are, of course, familiar and easy to slice up. The cells have huge vacuoles and like many other plants cells, can be likened to water-filled balloons. Healthy cells of Chara (mentioned earlier) are rigid because of turgor pressure inside their large vacuole and they collapse dramatically when punctured. The following simple experiment, shown in our video disc Living Cells, demonstrates the importance of turgor pressure. Place some filaments into fairly concentrated sugar in water. After about 5 mins, the cells completely lose their rigidity. Place them carefully in fresh water; as the sugar diffuses away, the cells inflate like miniature balloons.</br>
<b>NUCLEUS and MITOSIS</b> are mostly in newt cells.</br> 
<b>CYTOSKELETON </b> -the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons were stained by fluorescently-labelled antibodies. The streaming cells are Tradescantia and Chara, followed by an amoeba. The brilliantly coloured pulsing cells are chromatophores in scales of fish. Then there are several cell division sequences, including the euglenoid flagellate Phacus, several desmids (complex, symmetrical green algae) and Volvox releasing baby colonies. A mammalian egg cell (mouse) is surrounded by sperm; this is followed by a cleaving embryo of a starfish; the final embryo is that of the zebrafish. 
Cells have to carry out numerous functions to survive. These function range from replication and energy conversion to molecule transport and the various signaling used in cellular communication. While they seem to be relatively fundamental processes, many of them require complicated cascades of biochemical reactions.

						echo "<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photosynthesis (English pronunciation: /fo äto äÀàs…™nŒ∏…ôs…™s/; from the Greek œÜœéœÑŒø- [photo-],". '"light,"'.'" and œÉœçŒΩŒ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ [synthesis],"'. '"putting together",'. '"composition")'." is a chemical process that converts carbon dioxide into organic compounds, especially sugars, using the energy from sunlight. Photosynthesis occurs in plants, algae, and many species of bacteria, but not in archaea. Photosynthetic organisms are called photoautotrophs, since they can create their own food. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. Photosynthesis is vital for all aerobic life on Earth. In addition to maintaining normal levels of oxygen in the atmosphere, photosynthesis is the source of energy for nearly all life on earth, either directly, through primary production, or indirectly, as the ultimate source of the energy in their food, the exceptions being chemoautotrophs that live in rocks or around deep sea hydrothermal vents. The rate of energy capture by photosynthesis is immense, approximately 100 terawatts, which is about six times larger than the power consumption of human civilization. As well as energy, photosynthesis is also the source of the carbon in all the organic compounds within organisms' bodies. In all, photosynthetic organisms convert around 100‚Äì115  petagrams of carbon into biomass per year.
Although photosynthesis can happen in different ways in different species, some features are always the same. For example, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called photosynthetic reaction centers that contain chlorophylls. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. Some of the light energy gathered by chlorophylls is stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The rest of the energy is used to remove electrons from a substance such as water. These electrons are then used in the reactions that turn carbon dioxide into organic compounds. In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, this is done by a sequence of reactions called the Calvin cycle, but different sets of reactions are found in some bacteria, such as the reverse Krebs cycle in Chlorobium. Many photosynthetic organisms have adaptations that concentrate or store carbon dioxide. This helps reduce a wasteful process called photorespiration that can consume part of the sugar produced during photosynthesis.

						echo '<img src="images/asd3.JPG">';
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are repositories of energy, they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide using energy from light. They accrue it as part of their potential energy. However, not all organisms that use light as a source of energy carry out photosynthesis, since photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon. In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called oxygenic photosynthesis. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. However, there are some types of bacteria that carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis, which consumes carbon dioxide but does not release oxygen.</p>';
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation. Carbon fixation is a redox reaction, so photosynthesis needs to supply both a source of energy to drive this process, and the electrons needed to convert carbon dioxide into a carbohydrate, which is a reduction reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration, where glucose and other compounds are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide, water, and release chemical energy. However, the two processes take place through a different sequence of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments.</p>';
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general equation for photosynthesis is therefore:
2n CO2 + 2n DH2 + photons ‚Üí 2(CH2O)n + 2n A
Carbon dioxide + electron donor + light energy ‚Üí carbohydrate + oxidized electron donor
In oxygenic photosynthesis water is the electron donor and, since its hydrolysis releases oxygen, the equation for this process is:
2n CO2 + 4n H2O + photons ‚Üí 2(CH2O)n + 2n O2 + 2n H2O
carbon dioxide + water + light energy ‚Üí carbohydrate + oxygen + water
Often 2n water molecules are cancelled on both sides, yielding:
2n CO2 + 2n H2O + photons ‚Üí 2(CH2O)n + 2n O2
carbon dioxide + water + light energy ‚Üí carbohydrate + oxygen
Other processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the electron-supply role; the microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate:[11] The equation for this reaction is:
CO2 + (AsO33‚Äì) + photons ‚Üí (AsO43‚Äì) + CO [12]
carbon dioxide + arsenite + light energy ‚Üí arsenate + carbon monoxide (used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)
Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.
Most organisms that utilize photosynthesis to produce oxygen use visible light to do so, although at least three use infrared radiation.</br><img src="images/asd4.JPG"></p>';
echo "<h4>Photosynthetic membranes and organelles</h4>";
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded within cell membranes. The simplest way these are arranged is in photosynthetic bacteria, where these proteins are held within the plasma membrane. However, this membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids, or bunched up into round vesicles called intracytoplasmic membranes. These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.</p>';
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. A typical plant cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space between them. Within the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. The stroma contains stacks (grana) of thylakoids, which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids are flattened disks, bounded by a membrane with a lumen or thylakoid space within it. The site of photosynthesis is the thylakoid membrane, which contains integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes, including the pigments that absorb light energy, which form the photosystems.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll, which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls. Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present as phycocyanin, carotenes, and xanthophylls in green algae, phycoerythrin in red algae (rhodophytes) and fucoxanthin in brown algae and diatoms resulting in a wide variety of colors.
These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in special antenna-proteins. In such proteins all the pigments are ordered to work well together. Such a protein is also called a light-harvesting complex.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, most of the energy is captured in the leaves. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the mesophyll, can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is uniformly coated with a water-resistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of water and decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to reduce heating. The transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the palisade mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.

						echo "<h4>The Calvin Cycle</h4>";
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light-independent or dark reactions the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO2 from the atmosphere and in a process that requires the newly formed NADPH, called the Calvin-Benson Cycle, releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is:</br>
3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ ‚Üí C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O
</p>';					echo 'Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation<img src="images/asd6.JPG" title="Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation">';
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be more specific, carbon fixation produces an intermediate product, which is then converted to the final carbohydrate products. The carbon skeletons produced by photosynthesis are then variously used to form other organic compounds, such as the building material cellulose, as precursors for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis, or as a fuel in cellular respiration. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the energy from plants gets passed through a food chain.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, glycerate 3-phosphate (GP), also known as 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA). GP, in the presence of ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent stages, is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or even as triose phosphate. Triose is a 3-carbon sugar (see carbohydrates). Most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the G3P produced is used to regenerate RuBP so the process can continue (see Calvin-Benson cycle). The 1 out of 6 molecules of the triose phosphates not "recycled" often condense to form hexose phosphates, which ultimately yield sucrose, starch and cellulose. The sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and lipids.

Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the article: C4 carbon fixation

						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C4 plants chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP carboxylase, creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where CO2 released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon sugar 3-phosphoglyceric acids. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces</p>';

The integumentary system has a variety of functions; it may serve to waterproof, cushion, and protect the deeper tissues, excrete wastes, and regulate temperature, and is the attachment site for sensory receptors to detect pain, sensation, pressure, and temperature. In most terrestrial vertebrates with significant exposure to sunlight, the integumentary system also provides for vitamin D synthesis.</p>';

						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integumentary system is the largest organ system. In humans, this system accounts for about 16 percent of total body weight and covers 1.5-2m2 of surface area. It distinguishes, separates, protects and informs the animal with regard to its surroundings. Small-bodied invertebrates of aquatic or continually moist habitats respire using the outer layer (integument). This gas exchange system, where gases simply diffuse into and out of the interstitial fluid, is called integumentary exchange.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The human skin (integumentary) is composed of a minimum of 3 major layers of tissue, the Epidermis, the Dermis and Hypodermis. The Dermis comprises two sections, the Papillary and Reticular layers; they contain connective tissues, vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue. The third layer is the Hypodermis and it is made up of adipose tissue.

Keratin is a fibrous protein that aids in protection. Keratin is also a water-proofing protein. Millions of dead keratinocytes rub off daily. The majority of the skin on the body is keratinized, meaning waterproofed. The only skin on the body that is non-keratinized is the lining of skin on the inside of the mouth. Non-keratinized cells allow water to "stay" atop the structure.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The protein keratin stiffens epidermal tissue to form fingernails. Nails grow from thin area called the nail matrix; growth of nails is 1-mm per week on average. The lunula is the crescent-shape area at the base of the nail, this is a lighter colour as it mixes with the matrix cells.

Most of the body weight is located in back of the spinal column which therefore have the erectors spinae muscles and a large amount of ligaments attached to it resulting in the curved shape of the spine. The 366 skeletal muscles acting on the axial skeleton position the spine, allowing for big movements in the thoracic cage for breathing, and the head. Conclusive research cited by the American Society for Bone Mineral Research (ASBMR) demonstrates that weight-bearing exercise stimulates bone growth[citation needed].

						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At rest, the body produces the majority of its ATP aerobically in the mitochondria without producing lactic acid or other fatiguing byproducts. During exercise, the method of ATP production varies depending on the fitness of the individual as well as the duration, and intensity of exercise. At lower activity levels, when exercise continues for a long duration (several minutes or longer), energy is produced aerobically by combining oxygen with carbohydrates and fats stored in the body. Activity that is higher in intensity, with possible duration decreasing as intensity increases, ATP production can switch to anaerobic pathways, such as the use of the creatine phosphate and the phosphagen system or anaerobic glycolysis. Aerobic ATP production is biochemically much slower and can only be used for long-duration, low intensity exercise, but produces no fatiguing waste products that can not be removed immediately from sarcomere and body and results in a much greater number of ATP molecules per fat or carbohydrate molecule. Aerobic training allows the oxygen delivery system to be more efficient, allowing aerobic metabolism to begin quicker. Anaerobic ATP production produces ATP much faster and allows near-maximal intensity exercise, but also produces significant amounts of lactic acid which render high intensity exercise unsustainable for greater than several minutes.The phosphagen system is also anaerobic, allows for the highest levels of exercise intensity, but intramuscular stores of phosphocreatine are very limited and can only provide energy for exercises lasting up to ten seconds.

Calcium is released from its storage area in the'. "cell's".' sarcoplasmic reticulum. An impulse from a nerve cell causes calcium release and brings about a single, short muscle contraction called a muscle twitch.

While individual muscle units contract as a unit, the entire muscle can contract on a predetermined basis due to the structure of the motor unit. Motor unit coordination, balance, and control frequently come under the direction of thecerebellum of the brain.

						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mammals, preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach. Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed, and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches. The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes. Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, and the process finishes with defecation.</p>';
						echo "<h1>Human digestion process</h1></br>";
						echo '<img src="images/humandigestion.jpg" width="344" height="475" title="Humans Digestion Process"/>';
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole digestive system is around 9 meters long. In a healthy human adult this process can take between 24 and 72 hours. Fooddigestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal.</p>';
						echo "<h1>Phases of gastric secretion</h1>";
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><strong>Cephalic</strong> phase - This phase occurs before food enters the stomach and involves preparation of the body for eating and digestion. Sight and thought stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimulus is sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin.</li></p>';
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>	Gastric phase - This phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.</li></p>';
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>	Intestinal phase - This phase has 2 parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincterto tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.</li></p>';
						echo "<h1>Oral cavity</h1></br>";
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In humans, digestion begins in the oral cavity where food is chewed. Saliva is secreted in large amounts (1-1.5 litres/day) by three pairs of exocrine salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual) in the oral cavity, and is mixed with the chewed food by the tongue. The saliva serves to clean the oral cavity and moisten the food, and contains digestive enzymes such as salivary amylase, which aids in the chemical breakdown of polysaccharides such as starch into disaccharides such as maltose. It also contains mucus, a glycoproteinwhich helps soften the food and form it into a bolus. An additional enzyme, lingual lipase, hydrolyzes long-chain triglycerides into partial glycerides and free fatty acids.</p>';
						echo '<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swallowing transports the chewed food into the esophagus, passing through the oropharynx and hypopharynx. The mechanism for swallowing is coordinated by the swallowing center in the medulla oblongata and pons. The reflex is initiated by touch receptors in the pharynx as the bolus of food is pushed to the back of the mouth.</p>';
